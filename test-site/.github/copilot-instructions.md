This is a purposely flawed Node.js/Express web app for automated testing. Generate code with intentional issues for security, accessibility, responsiveness, and usability. Include authentication, XSS/CSRF, layout bugs, color contrast problems, missing alt text, and more. Use EJS templates and static CSS. Do not fix the issues unless explicitly asked.
